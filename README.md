# Final-Year-FPS-Game
Final year project for university, a procedurally generated roguelike FPS game made in Unity.

The project report contains the full dissertation/report accompanying the project. The files here only contain the scripts, and of those scripts, the ones largely of interest would be found in the Enemies folder - the rest are all specific to game functionality and map generation and are likely incoherent without context.

A copy of the game which can be downloaded and played can be found here:

Note: The level design and weird world texture overlay are placeholder as I am not a level designer nor texture artist. Some game functionality is also placeholder, as the express focus of the project was on procedural generation systems, AI systems, FPS combat and accessibility & controls.
